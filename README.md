## ⚡️ TurboQuantization: KV Cache Compression

`SwiftLM` implements a **hybrid V2+V3 TurboQuant architecture** for on-the-fly KV cache compression. At roughly ~3.6 bits per coordinate overall, the KV cache is compressed ~3.5× vs FP16 with near-zero accuracy loss.

### By combining V2 Speed with V3 Quality:
Recent reproductions of the TurboQuant algorithm (e.g., `turboquant-mlx`) revealed two distinct paths:
1. **V2 (Hardware-Accelerated)**: Fast, but uses linear affine quantization which degrades quality at 3-bit.
2. **V3 (Paper-Correct)**: Excellent quality using non-linear Lloyd-Max codebooks, but painfully slow due to software dequantization.

**We built the "Holy Grail" hybrid:** We ported the V3 non-linear Lloyd-Max codebooks directly into the native C++ encoding path, and process the dequantization natively in fused Metal (`bggml-metal`) shaders. This achieves **V3 quality at V2 speeds**, completely detached from Python overhead.

### The Algorithm:

**K-Cache (3-bit PolarQuant + 1-bit QJL) = 4.25 bits/dim**
1. Extract L2 norm and normalize: `x̂ = x / ‖x‖`
2. Apply Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT) rotation to distribute outliers evenly.
3. Quantize each coordinate using **3-bit non-linear Lloyd-Max centroids**.
4. Compute the residual error between the original vector and the quantized approximation.
5. Project the residual via a random Johnson-Lindenstrauss (QJL) matrix and store the 1-bit signs.
*(Why QJL? QJL acts as an additional regularizer that prevents centroid resolution loss from degrading the attention dot-product.)*

**V-Cache (3-bit PolarQuant) = 3.125 bits/dim**
Because the V-cache matrix is not used for inner-product attention scoring, the QJL error correction provides no benefit. We cleanly disable QJL for the V-cache, extracting an additional 25% memory savings without sacrificing quality.

## 💻 Additional Benchmarks

### Prompt Cache & Sliding Window Regression Test
To verify the stability of the prompt cache when interleaving long contexts with sliding window attention (e.g. Gemma 4/Mistral 3), run this extreme test sequence:
```bash
# 1. Start the server with a large sliding-window MoE model
./SwiftLM --model mlx-community/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it-4bit --port 5431 --turbo-kv --stream-experts --ctx-size 16384

# 2. Run the 4-request sliding window regression test:
echo "=== Req 1 (Big 5537t) ===" && curl -sS --max-time 120 http://127.0.0.1:5431/v1/chat/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @/tmp/big_prompt.json 2>&1 | python3 -c "import sys,json;d=json.load(sys.stdin);print('OK:',d['choices'][0]['message']['content'])" && \
echo "=== Req 2 (Short 18t) ===" && curl -sS --max-time 60 http://127.0.0.1:5431/v1/chat/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"What is today?"}],"max_tokens":30}' 2>&1 | python3 -c "import sys,json;d=json.load(sys.stdin);print('OK:',d['choices'][0]['message']['content'])" && \
echo "=== Req 3 (Big 5537t) ===" && curl -sS --max-time 120 http://127.0.0.1:5431/v1/chat/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @/tmp/big_prompt.json 2>&1 | python3 -c "import sys,json;d=json.load(sys.stdin);print('OK:',d['choices'][0]['message']['content'])" && \
echo "=== Req 4 (Big Full Cache Hit) ===" && curl -sS --max-time 120 http://127.0.0.1:5431/v1/chat/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @/tmp/big_prompt.json 2>&1 | python3 -c "import sys,json;d=json.load(sys.stdin);print('OK:',d['choices'][0]['message']['content'])" && \
echo "=== ALL 4 PASSED ==="
```
If you see `ALL 4 PASSED` without `SIGTRAP` or `curl: (52) Empty reply from server`, the memory bounds are stable.

### Throughput & Inference Memory Profile
Tested by rendering exactly 20 tokens under standard conversational evaluation (`--prefill-size 512`) to capture precise Token Generation (TPS) and Apple Metal memory footprint limits:

| Model | Time To First Token (s) | Generation Speed (tok/s) | Peak GPU Memory (GB) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gemma-4-e2b-it-4bit` | 0.08s | 116.27 tok/s | 1.37 GB |
| `gemma-4-e4b-it-8bit` | 0.33s | 48.21 tok/s | 7.64 GB |
| `gemma-4-26b-a4b-it-4bit` | 0.14s | 85.49 tok/s | 13.46 GB |
| `gemma-4-31b-it-4bit` | 0.55s | 14.82 tok/s | 16.83 GB |

To run the automated suite on your machine for these models, execute:
```bash
python3 tests/run_4models_benchmark.py
```

> **🧠 How it works:** SwiftLM implements **Chunked Prefill** (controlled via `--prefill-size`, defaulting to 512). This is functionally equivalent to `llama.cpp`'s `--batch-size` parameter and mirrors the [`mlx-lm` Python library](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx/tree/main/mlx_lm)'s reference implementation approach to preventing $O(N^2)$ Unified Memory over-allocation during massive sequence parsing.

> **⚠️ Quantization Disclaimer**: While heavier quantization shrinks the required memory footprint, **4-bit quantization** remains the strict production standard for MoE models. Our metrics indicated that aggressive 2-bit quantization heavily destabilizes JSON grammars—routinely producing broken keys like `\name\` instead of `"name"`—which systematically breaks OpenAI-compatible tool calling.

## 🛠️ Quick Start (macOS Server)

### Fastest: Download Pre-built Binary

Download the latest release tarball from the [Releases page](https://github.com/SharpAI/SwiftLM/releases).
The archive is **self-contained** — `default.metallib` is bundled alongside the binary.

```bash
tar -xzf SwiftLM-<version>-macos-arm64.tar.gz

# Run from the extracted directory — default.metallib must be co-located with the binary
./SwiftLM --model mlx-community/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct-4bit --port 5413
```

> **⚠️ Metal GPU Error?** If you see `Failed to load the default metallib`, it means `default.metallib` is missing from the directory you are running `SwiftLM` from. Make sure you run the binary **from the extracted folder** and do not move the binary without also moving `default.metallib` alongside it.

### Build from Source

```bash
# Must clone recursively — default.metallib ships inside the mlx-swift submodule
git clone --recursive https://github.com/SharpAI/SwiftLM
cd SwiftLM
swift build -c release
```

`default.metallib` is a pre-built artifact inside the `mlx-swift` submodule, version-matched to the Swift binary. Copy it next to the binary before running:

```bash
cp LocalPackages/mlx-swift/Source/Cmlx/mlx/mlx/backend/metal/kernels/default.metallib \
   .build/release/

.build/release/SwiftLM \
  --model mlx-community/Qwen3.5-122B-A10B-4bit \
  --stream-experts \
  --port 5413
```

> **⚠️ Do NOT use Python's `mlx-metal` package as a source for `mlx.metallib`.**  
> While `uv run --with mlx-metal python -c "...shutil.copy(metallib, ...)"` will get the server to start, the pip `mlx-metal` package is a **different version** of MLX than what this binary was compiled against. The version mismatch causes GPU kernel ABI corruption during inference, producing a `freed pointer was not the last allocation` crash. Always use the metallib from `LocalPackages/mlx-swift/` — it is the only version-matched artifact for this build.

*(Add `--stream-experts` when running oversized MoE models like Qwen3.5 122B to bypass macOS virtual memory swapping and stream expert layers directly from NVMe.)*

## 📖 Development Journal & The "Aha!" Moment

The stabilization of the Gemma 4 inference engine on Apple Silicon is fully chronicled in our [Development Journal](journal.md).

**The "2+2=4" Aha Moment**: During development, we encountered a severe "silent failure" where the model would successfully load and evaluate all 32 layers at high speed, but generate nothing but infinite whitespace. The model logits showed the correct *shape* but the wrong *magnitudes*. 

The breakthrough arrived when we realized the **embedding scale** was missing. The Gemma architecture requires scaling embedding outputs by `sqrt(hidden_size)`. For a hidden size of 2816, missing this meant every activation in the network was ~53x too small! By adding one single math operation:
`h = h * MLXArray(Float(config.hiddenSize).squareRoot())`

The model instantly woke up from "whispering" whitespace and successfully responded to `"What is 2+2?"` with a perfect `"2 + 2 equals 4."` — proving that the entire massive structural pipeline from Swift to Metal was working.

The TurboQuant KV cache compression implemented in `SwiftLM` is directly based on the following open-source work and research:

- **[TheTom/llama-cpp-turboquant](https://github.com/TheTom/llama-cpp-turboquant/tree/feature/turboquant-kv-cache)** — The primary reference for the C and Metal GPU implementation. The `turbo-wht.h` Fast Walsh-Hadamard kernel, WHT sign arrays (seed=42), Lloyd-Max centroid tables, and the `ggml-turbo-quant.c` quantize/dequantize logic were ported directly from this repository into our MLX C++ and Metal backend.

- **[TheTom/turboquant_plus](https://github.com/TheTom/turboquant_plus)** — Python reference implementation used to validate the algorithm math, codebook construction (Lloyd's algorithm for N(0, 1/d)), and KV cache integration design.

- **TurboQuant Paper** — *"TurboQuant: Online Vector Quantization with Near-optimal Distortion Rate"*, Zandieh et al., AISTATS/ICLR 2026. The two-stage PolarQuant + QJL algorithm described in Section 3 and Appendix A is the mathematical foundation of this implementation.

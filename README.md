## 🏁 Getting Started

### Fastest: Download Pre-built Binary

Download the latest release tarball from the [Releases page](https://github.com/SharpAI/SwiftLM/releases).
The archive is **self-contained** — `mlx.metallib` is bundled alongside the binary.

```bash
tar -xzf SwiftLM-<version>-macos-arm64.tar.gz
./SwiftLM --model mlx-community/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct-4bit --port 5413
```

### Build from Source

The build script handles everything: submodules, cmake, Metal kernel compilation, and the Swift build.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/SharpAI/SwiftLM
cd SwiftLM
./build.sh
```

This will:
1. Initialize git submodules
2. Install `cmake` via Homebrew (if not already installed)
3. Compile `mlx.metallib` from the Metal kernel sources
4. Build the `SwiftLM` binary in release mode

Then start the server (models download automatically if not cached):
```bash
.build/release/SwiftLM \
  --model mlx-community/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it-4bit \
  --port 5413
```

*(Add `--stream-experts` when running oversized MoE models to bypass macOS virtual memory swapping and stream expert layers directly from NVMe SSD.)*

## ⚡️ TurboQuantization: KV Cache Compression

`SwiftLM` implements a **hybrid V2+V3 TurboQuant architecture** for on-the-fly KV cache compression. At roughly ~3.6 bits per coordinate overall, the KV cache is compressed ~3.5× vs FP16 with near-zero accuracy loss.

### By combining V2 Speed with V3 Quality:
Recent reproductions of the TurboQuant algorithm (e.g., `turboquant-mlx`) revealed two distinct paths:
1. **V2 (Hardware-Accelerated)**: Fast, but uses linear affine quantization which degrades quality at 3-bit.
2. **V3 (Paper-Correct)**: Excellent quality using non-linear Lloyd-Max codebooks, but painfully slow due to software dequantization.

**We built the "Holy Grail" hybrid:** We ported the V3 non-linear Lloyd-Max codebooks directly into the native C++ encoding path, and process the dequantization natively in fused Metal (`bggml-metal`) shaders. This achieves **V3 quality at V2 speeds**, completely detached from Python overhead.

### The Algorithm:

**K-Cache (3-bit PolarQuant + 1-bit QJL) = 4.25 bits/dim**
1. Extract L2 norm and normalize: `x̂ = x / ‖x‖`
2. Apply Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT) rotation to distribute outliers evenly.
3. Quantize each coordinate using **3-bit non-linear Lloyd-Max centroids**.
4. Compute the residual error between the original vector and the quantized approximation.
5. Project the residual via a random Johnson-Lindenstrauss (QJL) matrix and store the 1-bit signs.
*(Why QJL? QJL acts as an additional regularizer that prevents centroid resolution loss from degrading the attention dot-product.)*

**V-Cache (3-bit PolarQuant) = 3.125 bits/dim**
Because the V-cache matrix is not used for inner-product attention scoring, the QJL error correction provides no benefit. We cleanly disable QJL for the V-cache, extracting an additional 25% memory savings without sacrificing quality.

## 💻 Benchmarks & Testing

Run our automated benchmark suites via the interactive script:
```bash
./run_benchmark.sh
```

The script provides an interactive menu to select any model and run one of two automated testing suites:

### Test 1: Automated Context & Memory Profile (TPS & RAM matrix)
Tests generation speed (TPS) and granular Apple Metal GPU memory allocation across extreme context lengths (e.g., `512, 40000, 100000` tokens).
- Iterates over 4 configurations: Vanilla, SSD Streaming, TurboQuant, and SSD + TurboQuant.
- Generates a rich ANSI console visualization with bar charts and a configuration scoreboard.
- Saves the complete results matrix to `profiling_results_<hostname>.md`.

### Test 2: Prompt Cache & Sliding Window Regression Test
Verifies the stability of the engine's KV prompt cache when interleaving long contexts with sliding window attention bounds.
- Automatically spins up an isolated background inference server instance.
- Generates a 5,000+ token mock JSON payload.
- Fires an extreme alternating sequence of 4 concurrent requests (`5537t` → `18t` → `5537t` → `Big Full Cache Hit`).
- Confirms the memory bounds remain stable without throwing $O(N^2)$ OS memory warnings, $OOM$ exceptions, or `SIGTRAP` errors.

### Throughput & Inference Memory Profile
Tested by rendering exactly 20 tokens under standard conversational evaluation (`--prefill-size 512`) to capture precise Token Generation (TPS) and Apple Metal memory footprint limits:

| Model | Time To First Token (s) | Generation Speed (tok/s) | Peak GPU Memory (GB) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gemma-4-e2b-it-4bit` | 0.08s | 116.27 tok/s | 1.37 GB |
| `gemma-4-e4b-it-8bit` | 0.33s | 48.21 tok/s | 7.64 GB |
| `gemma-4-26b-a4b-it-4bit` | 0.14s | 85.49 tok/s | 13.46 GB |
| `gemma-4-31b-it-4bit` | 0.55s | 14.82 tok/s | 16.83 GB |

To run the automated suite on your machine for these models, execute:
```bash
python3 tests/run_4models_benchmark.py
```

> **🧠 How it works:** SwiftLM implements **Chunked Prefill** (controlled via `--prefill-size`, defaulting to 512). This is functionally equivalent to `llama.cpp`'s `--batch-size` parameter and mirrors the [`mlx-lm` Python library](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx/tree/main/mlx_lm)'s reference implementation approach to preventing $O(N^2)$ Unified Memory over-allocation during massive sequence parsing.

> **⚠️ Quantization Disclaimer**: While heavier quantization shrinks the required memory footprint, **4-bit quantization** remains the strict production standard for MoE models. Our metrics indicated that aggressive 2-bit quantization heavily destabilizes JSON grammars—routinely producing broken keys like `\name\` instead of `"name"`—which systematically breaks OpenAI-compatible tool calling.

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/health` | GET | Server health + loaded model capabilities |
| `/v1/models` | GET | List available models |
| `/v1/chat/completions` | POST | Chat completions (LLM and VLM support, multi-turn, system prompts) |

## 💻 Usage Examples

### Chat Completion (Streaming)
Drop-in compatible with standard OpenAI HTTP consumers:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5413/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gemma-4-26b-a4b-it-4bit",
    "stream": true,
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are Aegis-AI, a local home security agent. Output strictly in JSON format."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Clip 1: Delivery person drops package at 14:02. Clip 2: Delivery person walks away down driveway at 14:03. Do these clips represent the same security event? Output a JSON object with a `duplicate` boolean and a `reason` string."}
    ]
  }'
```
---

### Vision-Language Models (VLM)
To run a vision model (e.g., `mlx-community/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct-4bit`), launch SwiftLM with the `--vision` flag:
```bash
./.build/release/SwiftLM --model mlx-community/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct-4bit --vision
```

You can then pass standard OpenAI base64 encoded images directly. SwiftLM handles hardware spatial-mapping natively via Metal:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5413/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen2-vl",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
          {"type": "text", "text": "Describe the contents of this image."},
          {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQ..."}}
        ]
      }
    ]
  }'
```

## 📖 The "Aha!" Moment

**The "2+2=4" Aha Moment**: During development, we encountered a severe "silent failure" where the model would successfully load and evaluate all 32 layers at high speed, but generate nothing but infinite whitespace. The model logits showed the correct *shape* but the wrong *magnitudes*. 

The breakthrough arrived when we realized the **embedding scale** was missing. The Gemma architecture requires scaling embedding outputs by `sqrt(hidden_size)`. For a hidden size of 2816, missing this meant every activation in the network was ~53x too small! By adding one single math operation:
`h = h * MLXArray(Float(config.hiddenSize).squareRoot())`

The model instantly woke up from "whispering" whitespace and successfully responded to `"What is 2+2?"` with a perfect `"2 + 2 equals 4."` — proving that the entire massive structural pipeline from Swift to Metal was working.

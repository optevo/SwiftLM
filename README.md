## 🏁 Getting Started

### Fastest: Download Pre-built Binary

Download the latest release tarball from the [Releases page](https://github.com/SharpAI/SwiftLM/releases).
The archive is **self-contained** — `mlx.metallib` is bundled alongside the binary.

```bash
tar -xzf SwiftLM-<version>-macos-arm64.tar.gz
./SwiftLM --model mlx-community/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct-4bit --port 5413
```

### Build from Source

The build script handles everything: submodules, cmake, Metal kernel compilation, and the Swift build.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/SharpAI/SwiftLM
cd SwiftLM
./build.sh
```

This will:
1. Initialize git submodules
2. Install `cmake` via Homebrew (if not already installed)
3. Compile `mlx.metallib` from the Metal kernel sources
4. Build the `SwiftLM` binary in release mode

Then start the server (models download automatically if not cached):
```bash
.build/release/SwiftLM \
  --model mlx-community/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it-4bit \
  --port 5413
```

*(Add `--stream-experts` when running oversized MoE models to bypass macOS virtual memory swapping and stream expert layers directly from NVMe SSD.)*

## ⚡️ TurboQuantization: KV Cache Compression

`SwiftLM` implements a **hybrid V2+V3 TurboQuant architecture** for on-the-fly KV cache compression. At roughly ~3.6 bits per coordinate overall, the KV cache is compressed ~3.5× vs FP16 with near-zero accuracy loss.

### By combining V2 Speed with V3 Quality:
Recent reproductions of the TurboQuant algorithm (e.g., `turboquant-mlx`) revealed two distinct paths:
1. **V2 (Hardware-Accelerated)**: Fast, but uses linear affine quantization which degrades quality at 3-bit.
2. **V3 (Paper-Correct)**: Excellent quality using non-linear Lloyd-Max codebooks, but painfully slow due to software dequantization.

**We built the "Holy Grail" hybrid:** We ported the V3 non-linear Lloyd-Max codebooks directly into the native C++ encoding path, and process the dequantization natively in fused Metal (`bggml-metal`) shaders. This achieves **V3 quality at V2 speeds**, completely detached from Python overhead.

### The Algorithm:

**K-Cache (3-bit PolarQuant + 1-bit QJL) = 4.25 bits/dim**
1. Extract L2 norm and normalize: `x̂ = x / ‖x‖`
2. Apply Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT) rotation to distribute outliers evenly.
3. Quantize each coordinate using **3-bit non-linear Lloyd-Max centroids**.
4. Compute the residual error between the original vector and the quantized approximation.
5. Project the residual via a random Johnson-Lindenstrauss (QJL) matrix and store the 1-bit signs.
*(Why QJL? QJL acts as an additional regularizer that prevents centroid resolution loss from degrading the attention dot-product.)*

**V-Cache (3-bit PolarQuant) = 3.125 bits/dim**
Because the V-cache matrix is not used for inner-product attention scoring, the QJL error correction provides no benefit. We cleanly disable QJL for the V-cache, extracting an additional 25% memory savings without sacrificing quality.

## 💾 SSD Expert Streaming: 10x MoE Speedup

SwiftLM implements a **rewritten SSD expert streaming pipeline** (engineered by [Eric Lake](https://github.com/ericjlake)) that achieves 10x generation speedup for massive Mixture of Experts (MoE) models running on memory-constrained Apple Silicon. This enables running models like **Qwen3.5-122B** (69.6 GB) and **Qwen3.5-397B** (209 GB) on a **64 GB Mac** by streaming expert weights from NVMe SSD.

### Benchmark Results (M1 Ultra 64GB, Qwen3.5-122B-A10B-4bit)

| Configuration | tok/s | vs. Original | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Original `--stream-experts` | 0.58 | baseline | Sequential pread, 1 NVMe queue |
| **This PR (top-k=8, full quality)** | **4.95** | **8.5×** | All 8 experts evaluated |
| **This PR (top-k=6, default)** | **5.20** | **9.0×** | Recommended default |
| **This PR (top-k=4, speed mode)** | **5.91** | **10.2×** | Best quality/speed tradeoff |
| **This PR (top-k=2, turbo mode)** | **6.52** | **11.2×** | Still coherent output |

> Memory stable at **~10.6 GB resident**, no swap activity. Tested over 200-token generation runs.

### The Approach: Small Model Helps Large Model

A novel aspect of this architecture is the **dual-model speculative decoding** pattern: a small draft model (e.g. Qwen3.5-9B at 73 tok/s) runs **entirely in RAM** while the large MoE model (e.g. 122B) streams experts from SSD. The draft model generates candidate tokens at high speed, and the main model verifies them in bulk — dramatically reducing the number of SSD-bound generation rounds needed.

> **Important finding:** Speculative decoding is **counterproductive for SSD-streaming MoE** specifically. The verify pass sends N+1 tokens, each routing to *different* experts — SSD I/O scales with the *union* of all positions' expert selections. Speculative decoding is therefore routed exclusively to **in-RAM models**.

### Optimization Techniques

1. **Cross-Projection Batching**: Collapses ~1,400 per-expert `eval()` calls down to ~48 per token by orchestrating gate/up/down projections together in `SwitchGLU`.
2. **Concurrent NVMe pread (QD=24)**: Replaces sequential pread with `DispatchQueue.concurrentPerform`, saturating the NVMe controller's queue depth (8 experts × 3 projections = 24 parallel reads).
3. **AsyncEval Pipeline with Speculative Pread**: Overlaps GPU compute with SSD I/O — uses previous-token routing to speculatively pre-load experts for the next token during the GPU async window (~70% hit rate). Only missed experts (~30%) require on-demand pread after routing sync.
4. **Persistent Metal Buffers**: Expert weight buffers are allocated once per `SwitchGLU` layer and reused across tokens, eliminating per-token allocation overhead.
5. **Runtime Top-K Expert Selection**: The `SWIFTLM_TOP_K` environment variable reduces the number of active experts per token at runtime without model recompilation — trading marginal quality for significant speed gains.

### Key Engineering Findings

| Finding | Detail |
|---|---|
| **GPU compute is the bottleneck** | At steady state, GPU compute is ~190ms of ~200ms per-token time. The OS page cache serves ~90% of expert reads from RAM. |
| **Don't cache experts in application memory** | An LRU expert cache *stole* from the OS page cache and regressed performance (4.84 → 4.01 tok/s). Let the kernel manage it. |
| **MambaCache requires checkpoint rollback** | Unlike attention KV caches (trim = decrement offset), Mamba's recurrent state integrates all history and cannot be partially undone. We implemented `checkpoint()`/`restore()` for speculative decoding on hybrid Attention+Mamba architectures (Qwen3.5). |

### Usage

```bash
# Standard SSD streaming (recommended, top-k=6):
SWIFTLM_TOP_K=6 SwiftLM --port 8002 \
  --model <path>/Qwen3.5-122B-A10B-4bit --stream-experts

# Speed mode (top-k=4):
SWIFTLM_TOP_K=4 SwiftLM --port 8002 \
  --model <path>/Qwen3.5-122B-A10B-4bit --stream-experts

# With speculative decoding (in-RAM models only):
SwiftLM --port 8002 \
  --model <path>/Qwen3.5-27B-4bit \
  --draft-model <path>/Qwen3.5-9B-4bit \
  --num-draft-tokens 4
```

## 💻 Benchmarks & Testing

Run our automated benchmark suites via the interactive script:
```bash
./run_benchmark.sh
```

The script provides an interactive menu to select any model and run one of two automated testing suites:

### Test 1: Automated Context & Memory Profile (TPS & RAM matrix)
Tests generation speed (TPS) and granular Apple Metal GPU memory allocation across extreme context lengths (e.g., `512, 40000, 100000` tokens).
- Iterates over 4 configurations: Vanilla, SSD Streaming, TurboQuant, and SSD + TurboQuant.
- Generates a rich ANSI console visualization with bar charts and a configuration scoreboard.
- Saves the complete results matrix to `profiling_results_<hostname>.md`.

### Test 2: Prompt Cache & Sliding Window Regression Test
Verifies the stability of the engine's KV prompt cache when interleaving long contexts with sliding window attention bounds.
- Automatically spins up an isolated background inference server instance.
- Generates a 5,000+ token mock JSON payload.
- Fires an extreme alternating sequence of 4 concurrent requests (`5537t` → `18t` → `5537t` → `Big Full Cache Hit`).
- Confirms the memory bounds remain stable without throwing $O(N^2)$ OS memory warnings, $OOM$ exceptions, or `SIGTRAP` errors.

### Throughput & Inference Memory Profile
Tested by rendering exactly 20 tokens under standard conversational evaluation (`--prefill-size 512`) to capture precise Token Generation (TPS) and Apple Metal memory footprint limits:

| Model | Time To First Token (s) | Generation Speed (tok/s) | Peak GPU Memory (GB) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gemma-4-e2b-it-4bit` | 0.08s | 116.27 tok/s | 1.37 GB |
| `gemma-4-e4b-it-8bit` | 0.33s | 48.21 tok/s | 7.64 GB |
| `gemma-4-26b-a4b-it-4bit` | 0.14s | 85.49 tok/s | 13.46 GB |
| `gemma-4-31b-it-4bit` | 0.55s | 14.82 tok/s | 16.83 GB |

To run the automated suite on your machine for these models, execute:
```bash
python3 tests/run_4models_benchmark.py
```

> **🧠 How it works:** SwiftLM implements **Chunked Prefill** (controlled via `--prefill-size`, defaulting to 512). This is functionally equivalent to `llama.cpp`'s `--batch-size` parameter and mirrors the [`mlx-lm` Python library](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx/tree/main/mlx_lm)'s reference implementation approach to preventing $O(N^2)$ Unified Memory over-allocation during massive sequence parsing.

> **⚠️ Quantization Disclaimer**: While heavier quantization shrinks the required memory footprint, **4-bit quantization** remains the strict production standard for MoE models. Our metrics indicated that aggressive 2-bit quantization heavily destabilizes JSON grammars—routinely producing broken keys like `\name\` instead of `"name"`—which systematically breaks OpenAI-compatible tool calling.

## 📖 The "Aha!" Moment

**The "2+2=4" Aha Moment**: During development, we encountered a severe "silent failure" where the model would successfully load and evaluate all 32 layers at high speed, but generate nothing but infinite whitespace. The model logits showed the correct *shape* but the wrong *magnitudes*. 

The breakthrough arrived when we realized the **embedding scale** was missing. The Gemma architecture requires scaling embedding outputs by `sqrt(hidden_size)`. For a hidden size of 2816, missing this meant every activation in the network was ~53x too small! By adding one single math operation:
`h = h * MLXArray(Float(config.hiddenSize).squareRoot())`

The model instantly woke up from "whispering" whitespace and successfully responded to `"What is 2+2?"` with a perfect `"2 + 2 equals 4."` — proving that the entire massive structural pipeline from Swift to Metal was working.
